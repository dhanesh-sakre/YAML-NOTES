in the school file I have taken same example to demonstrate the acutal difference b/w these files.
same content is presented in 3 different formats.

school.yaml
school.xml
school.json

as these files are going to be used much more while automization, it is necessary to have a good understanding of yaml file...

inshot.yaml---> like Teaser of yaml movie
datatypes.yaml --> datatypes used in yaml files
practical.yaml --> basic concept
advanceddatatype.yaml---> llittle bit advanced concept
...
