**** like python and jave, YAML can store dictionary and hashmaps... in 
"key : vlaue" pairs.

"key" : "value"
"apple" : "I am  a red fruit."
8843389 : "this is roll no"
---

#list 
- apple
- mango
- banana
- cherry
- grapes
- APPLE     #apple and APPLE is different coz YAML is case sensitive language.

---

# this list would look like this in JSON file:
[
  "apple",
  "mango",
  "banana",
  "cherry",
  "grapes",
  "APPLE"
]

---
#BLOCK STYLE

cities:
  - mumbai
  - new delhi
  - hydrabad
  - pune
  - bangluru
  - chennai       #indentation is important
---

# in JSON this would look like this::
{
  "cities": [
    "mumbai",
    "new delhi",
    "hydrabad",
    "pune",
    "bangluru",
    "chennai"
  ]
}

NOTE: (1) we can check for validation in YAML validator (https://www.yamllint.com/)
      (2) we can seperate objects by using 3 consecutive dashes ("---").
      (3) to tell the document is ended, use 3 dots ("...")
      (4) we can convert YAML file to JSON file using - https://onlineyamltools.com/convert-yaml-to-json
