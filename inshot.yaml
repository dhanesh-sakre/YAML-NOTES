  YAML:
  extentions -->   .yaml / .yml         both are valid.

  it's not a programming language.

  previously known as--> "yet another markup language".

  now a days : yaml ain't markup language.

--------
 yaml is a markup language, it means it contians data in a form like
child parent relationship. the relationship like, what goes inside and how they are layered
is the makup language just like HTML.
---------

* similar to JSON and XML files
* data format used to exchange data
* stores only data (not commands)
-----------

as we have studie that python is object oriented language and what object is.
here it is going to be used.
object(code + data) : An object is a component of a program that knows how to perform certain actions 
      and how to interact with other elements of the program.
         Objects are the basic units of object-oriented programming like python.
----------------------------

DATA SERIALIZATION:
===================  to convert objects into complex data structure like stream of
                     bytes(chunks of data). This is data serialization.
                     this makes transmission easier.


      [object-->  stream_of_byteS ] ---> :DEVICE(YAML/DATABASE/MEMORY): ----> [stream_of_bytes ----> object]
                  |                                                                     |
        DATA SERIALIZATION                                                        DATA DESRIALIZATION
          ==============                                                           ===================
                
              
****** data serialization languages ---> YAML, JSON, XML
we can store data in format in code and use this files to convert into object.


DATA DESERIALIZATION:
====================== We take this data from device and cnvert into data objects. This
                          is called data deserialization.

--------------------------------------------------


USE case: [configuration files for DOCKER, CUBERNATES etc..]
===========
 let's take an example 
let's say we want to run 30 apps on 5 instances, 6 apps each.
kucbernetes is gonna say that ok I will do this for you. I have object like a pot.

but we need to tell it how the objects should be look like... 
we shall give it a written document, in which we are gonna specify the things we want..
and this files may be JSON or YAML OR XML etc....



Benifits:
==========
* HUMAN READABLE, simple and easy to read
* strict synatax, indentation is important like Python
* easily convertable to JSON and XML
* most Popular languages for usecase like this
* more powerful when representing complex data 
* can use various tools by using it like PARSSERS(reading the data is easy) etc...
